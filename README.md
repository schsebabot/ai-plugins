# ai-plugins

A collection of AI agent skills and slash commands for day-to-day software development. These plugins supercharge your AI coding assistant with structured workflows for feature development, code review, PR comment resolution, and Jira integration.

Built on the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard — works with **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and any editor that supports the standard.

## Installation

### Claude Code

**Option A — Plugin Marketplace (recommended)**

Run these slash commands inside a Claude Code session:

1. Add the marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add SchSeba/ai-plugins
```

2. Install the plugin:

```
/plugin install ai-plugins@ai-plugins
```

> The install syntax is `<plugin-name>@<marketplace-name>`. Both are `ai-plugins` in this case — the plugin name comes from `plugin.json` and the marketplace name from the GitHub repo name.

Claude Code will prompt you to choose an installation scope:

| Scope | Effect | When to use |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **User** | Available in all your projects | You want these skills everywhere (recommended) |
| **Project** | Shared with collaborators via `.claude/plugins.json` | Team-wide adoption for a specific project |
| **Local** | Per-user, per-repo (not committed) | Personal testing in a single repo |

Once installed, the skills are namespaced under the plugin name. For example:

```
/ai-plugins:develop-feature Add JWT authentication
/ai-plugins:code-review review-pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42
```

**Option B — Skills Directory**

Clone the repo into your Claude skills directory for auto-loading without the marketplace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SchSeba/ai-plugins.git ~/.claude/skills/ai-plugins
```

Skills loaded this way are available directly (without namespacing):

```
/develop-feature Add JWT authentication
```

**Option C — Plugin Directory (development/testing only)**

For local development or testing changes to the plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SchSeba/ai-plugins.git
claude --plugin-dir ./ai-plugins
```

### Cursor

**Option A — Remote Rule from GitHub (recommended)**

1. Open **Cursor Settings** → **Rules**
2. Click **Add Rule** → select **Remote Rule (GitHub)**
3. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/SchSeba/ai-plugins`

Cursor will pull the skills and commands automatically.

**Option B — Copy skills to your project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SchSeba/ai-plugins.git

# Project-level (available in this project only):
cp -r ai-plugins/skills/* .cursor/skills/
cp -r ai-plugins/commands/* .cursor/commands/

# User-level (available across all projects):
cp -r ai-plugins/skills/* ~/.cursor/skills/
cp -r ai-plugins/commands/* ~/.cursor/commands/
```

---

### develop-feature

A three-phase development workflow: **Plan → Code → Review** with automated iteration until the review passes.

The agent plans the implementation, writes production-grade code with tests, then reviews its own work. If the review finds issues, it loops back to coding and fixes them — up to 3 iterations.

```
+----------+     +----------+     +----------+
|   PLAN   | --> |   CODE   | --> |  REVIEW  |
+----------+     +----------+     +----------+
                      ^                |
                      |    changes     |
                      |   requested    |
                      +----------------+
```

**Usage:**

```
/develop-feature Add user authentication with JWT tokens
```

```
/develop-feature Fix the race condition in the connection pool cleanup
```

```
/develop-feature Refactor the payment service to use the strategy pattern
```

### code-review

Multi-perspective code review that spawns parallel specialist reviewers (security, performance, language-specific, testing, etc.) and aggregates their findings into a single verdict.

Supports two modes:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `review-pr <pr-url>` | Review a GitHub pull request |
| `review-change [project-path]` | Review uncommitted or staged local changes |

**Usage:**

```
/code-review review-pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42
```

```
/code-review review-change
```

```
/code-review review-change ./services/auth
```

---

### review-engine

The shared low-level review engine used by `code-review` and `develop-feature`. It handles diff analysis, file categorization, parallel reviewer spawning, finding aggregation, and verdict rendering.

You typically don't call this directly — it's invoked automatically by the other skills. Use it directly when you want the raw review engine on an arbitrary diff.

**Usage:**

```
/review-engine
```

```
/review-engine Review the changes in the last 3 commits
```

---

### pr-comment-resolver

Interactively resolves PR review comments one at a time. For each comment, the agent shows the code, the reviewer's feedback, and a suggested fix — then waits for your approval before applying it.

**Usage:**

```
/pr-comment-resolver https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42
```

```
/pr-comment-resolver my-project https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42
```

**Workflow:**

1. Fetches all unresolved review comments from the PR
2. Filters to actionable comments (skips resolved threads and pure praise)
3. Shows a numbered summary of all actionable comments
4. Presents each comment one-by-one with the code snippet, reviewer feedback, and suggested fix
5. Waits for your approval (`yes` / `no` / `skip`) before applying each change
6. Runs validation after each approved change
7. Shows a final summary of addressed vs. skipped comments

---

### jira-cli

Query your Jira tasks and epics using the [jira-cli](https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli) tool.

**Prerequisites:**

- `jira` CLI installed and configured (`jira init` already run)
- `JIRA_API_TOKEN` exported in the shell

**Usage:**

```
/jira-cli get_my_tasks
```

```
/jira-cli get_my_tasks MYPROJ 10
```

```
/jira-cli get_my_epics openshift-4.22
```

```
/jira-cli get_my_epics openshift-4.22 OCPBUGS 50
```

| Subcommand | Arguments | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `get_my_tasks` | `[PROJECT] [LIMIT]` | List open tasks assigned to you, ordered by last updated |
| `get_my_epics` | `[VERSION] [PROJECT] [LIMIT]` | List your epics, optionally filtered by fix-version |

---

### write-a-skill

Step-by-step workflow for creating a new skill in this repository. Guides you through requirements gathering, directory creation, writing the skill body with proper information hierarchy, crafting the description, creating the command file, registering in README.md, and running the review checklist.

Integrates best practices from [mattpocock's writing-great-skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/skills/productivity/writing-great-skills/SKILL.md) — including completion criteria, leading words, progressive disclosure, and failure mode awareness.

**Usage:**

```
/write-a-skill Create a skill for database migration management
```

```
/write-a-skill
```

Includes a [`GLOSSARY.md`](skills/write-a-skill/GLOSSARY.md) with domain vocabulary for skill authoring (predictability, leading words, information hierarchy, failure modes, etc.).

```

**How it works:**

- **Skills** (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) contain the detailed agent instructions — the workflow steps, criteria, and guidelines that teach the AI how to perform a task.
- **Commands** (`commands/<name>.md`) are the user-facing slash commands that route to the appropriate skill.
- **Plugin manifests** (`.claude-plugin/` and `.cursor-plugin/`) register the skills, commands, and MCP servers with the respective editors.

## MCP Servers

The repository includes a pre-configured [GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) in `.mcp.json`. This gives skills access to GitHub APIs for fetching PR data, review comments, and more.

**Setup:**

1. Export your GitHub token:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
   ```

2. The config uses `podman` by default. If you use Docker, update `.mcp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "github": {
       "command": "docker",
       "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN", "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"],
       "env": {
         "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Contributing

Skills are plain Markdown files — no executable code required. To add a new skill:

1. Read and follow the [`write-a-skill`](skills/write-a-skill/SKILL.md) skill for the complete workflow
2. Create `skills/<your-skill>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and the skill workflow in Markdown
3. Create a matching `commands/<your-skill>.md` that routes to your skill
4. **Add the new skill and command to this README** — both the Skills table and the dedicated section, in alphabetical order
5. Follow the existing patterns — see any skill directory for reference
